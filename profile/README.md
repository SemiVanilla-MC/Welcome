Welcome to the official Github org for the NewLands MC Minecraft server. We were a team of Minecraft players with over 20 years combined experience running Minecraft servers. We specialized in semi-vanilla and vanilla+ servers that provide a unique survival experience that players new and old can all enjoy.

~~Most content in this org is private and only visible by team members.~~

As of December 15th, 2023 this org has been made public so that anyone can reference and reuse the custom plugins, configs, and hosting guidelines we used during our time running servers.

## How do I use this org?

Start at the wiki where I have laid out what repos are available in this org what you'll find in each one. - https://github.com/newlandsmc/wiki

You should be able to create an identical clone of NewLands MC using this org. All of the custom plugins, configurations, and host details are available here.

## What was NewLands MC?

NewLands MC was a collection of Minecraft server projects I hosted from 2020 to 2023. I've been experimenting with Minecraft servers for over 10 years. They've always been an outlet to experiment, learn, and develop IT skills like code development, infrastructure management, security, automation, and more. I hope the resources in this org can help someone else find the same joy I did in learning these skills using the ultimate sandbox game - Minecraft.
